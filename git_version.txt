5. Merging via command line
If you do not want to use the merge button or an automatic merge cannot be performed, you can perform a manual merge on the command line. However, the following steps are not applicable if the base branch is protected.
Step 1: Clone the repository or update your local repository with the latest changes.
git pull origin main
Step 2: Switch to the base branch of the pull request.
git checkout main
Step 3: Merge the head branch into the base branch.
git merge master
Step 4: Push the changes.
git push -u origin main
